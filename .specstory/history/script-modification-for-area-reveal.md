## Script Modification for Area Reveal (2/9/2025, 11:33:35 PM)

_**User**_

now please change @AreaRevealMine.cs, it should use @MineShape.cs and @MineShapeHelper.cs instead of using radius, 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help modify the `AreaRevealMine.cs` to use the shape system instead of the radius-based circle approach. First, let me analyze what needs to be changed:

1. The mine should use `MineShape` and `MineShapeHelper` for revealing cells
2. We'll need to modify how it uses the `m_Data.TriggerRadius` to work with the shape system
3. Replace the circular area reveal logic with shape-based reveal

Let me modify the file:

---

_****_

```diff
          private void RevealArea()
          {
-             int radius = Mathf.RoundToInt(m_Data.TriggerRadius);
-             for (int x = -radius; x <= radius; x++)
-             {
-                 for (int y = -radius; y <= radius; y++)
-                 {
-                     if (x * x + y * y <= radius * radius)
-                     {
-                         Vector2Int position = m_Position + new Vector2Int(x, y);
+             int range = Mathf.RoundToInt(m_Data.TriggerRadius);
+             var positions = MineShapeHelper.GetShapePositions(m_Position, MineShape.Diamond, range);
+             
+             foreach (var position in positions)
+             {
                  GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed(position);
-                     }
-                 }
              }
          }
```

I've made the following changes to `AreaRevealMine.cs`:

1. Replaced the circular area calculation with the `MineShapeHelper.GetShapePositions()` method
2. Used `MineShape.Diamond` as it's the closest equivalent to the previous circular reveal pattern
3. Kept the `TriggerRadius` as the range parameter but renamed the variable to `range` to match the shape system terminology
4. Simplified the reveal logic to iterate through the pre-calculated positions

The new implementation will:
- Be more consistent with the game's shape system
- Be more efficient as it uses the pre-built shape helper
- Maintain similar gameplay feel by using the diamond shape which approximates the previous circular pattern
- Be easier to modify in the future if you want to change the reveal shape

The functionality remains similar but now integrates properly with your shape system. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

---

_**User**_

but it seems not working, (I set this mine's data as square shape with range 3

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue! The mine is currently hardcoded to use `MineShape.Diamond` regardless of what shape is set in the mine's data. We should use the shape from the mine data instead. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
          {
              int range = Mathf.RoundToInt(m_Data.TriggerRadius);
-             var positions = MineShapeHelper.GetShapePositions(m_Position, MineShape.Diamond, range);
+             var positions = MineShapeHelper.GetShapePositions(m_Position, m_Data.Shape, range);
              
              foreach (var position in positions)
```

---

_****_



I've changed the `RevealArea` method to use `m_Data.Shape` instead of the hardcoded `MineShape.Diamond`. Now it will properly use whatever shape is set in the mine's data - in your case, it will use `MineShape.Square` with range 3, which should reveal a 7x7 square area (3 cells in each direction from the center, plus the center cell).

The area reveal should now work correctly according to the shape you've set in the mine's data. You should see a square pattern of revealed cells when this mine is triggered.

_**User**_

 still not working, maybe you should check other files

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the related files to understand how the mine data and shape system are connected.

I see the issue now. Looking at the `MineData` class, I can see that there are two separate properties:
1. `TriggerRadius` - used for area effects
2. `ShapeRange` - used for the shape pattern

In our `AreaRevealMine`, we're using `TriggerRadius` when we should be using `ShapeRange`. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
          private void RevealArea()
          {
-             int range = Mathf.RoundToInt(m_Data.TriggerRadius);
-             var positions = MineShapeHelper.GetShapePositions(m_Position, m_Data.Shape, range);
+             var positions = MineShapeHelper.GetShapePositions(m_Position, m_Data.Shape, m_Data.ShapeRange);
              
              foreach (var position in positions)
```

---

_****_



I've made the following change:
1. Removed the use of `TriggerRadius` and replaced it with `ShapeRange`
2. Removed the unnecessary `Mathf.RoundToInt()` since `ShapeRange` is already an integer

The issue was that we were using the wrong property from `MineData`. `TriggerRadius` is meant for area effects (like explosions or damage areas), while `ShapeRange` is specifically designed for the shape pattern system. Now the mine should properly reveal cells in a square pattern with the range you specified (3).

When you trigger the mine now, it should reveal a square area of cells with a range of 3 cells in each direction from the center. Let me know if you need any adjustments!

still not working

_**Assistant**_

Let me check how the mine data is being used and how the reveal system works. I'll look for the `GameEvents` class and how cell revealing is handled.

Let me check the `Grid` class to see how cell revealing is implemented:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Core/Grid/Grid.cs

---

_****_



I see the issue now. The `AreaRevealMine` is sending reveal events for positions, but we need to check if those positions are valid within the grid bounds. Let me modify the `AreaRevealMine` to only reveal cells that are within the grid:

---

_****_

```diff
              foreach (var position in positions)
              {
+                 // Only reveal cells that are within the grid bounds
+                 if (GridManager.Instance.IsValidPosition(position))
+                 {
                      GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed(position);
+                 }
              }
          }
```

---

_****_



I see we need to get a reference to the `GridManager` first. Let me modify the code to properly get the `GridManager` reference:

---

_****_

```diff
      public class AreaRevealMine : BaseMine
      {
+         private GridManager m_GridManager;
+ 
          public override bool CanDisguise => true; // Can look like a radar device
  
          public AreaRevealMine(MineData _data, Vector2Int _position) : base(_data, _position)
          {
+             m_GridManager = Object.FindObjectOfType<GridManager>();
          }
  
              {
                  // Only reveal cells that are within the grid bounds
-                 if (GridManager.Instance.IsValidPosition(position))
+                 if (m_GridManager != null && m_GridManager.IsValidPosition(position))
                  {
                      GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed(position);
```

---

_****_



I see the issue. The `GridManager` doesn't expose the `IsValidPosition` method directly. Instead, we need to use the `Grid` class's method. Let me check how to access the grid from `GridManager`:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Managers/GridManager.cs

---

_****_



I see that `GridManager` already handles the position validation in its `HandleCellRevealed` method. We don't actually need to do the validation in `AreaRevealMine` since `GridManager` will handle it. Let me update the code:

---

_****_

```diff
      public class AreaRevealMine : BaseMine
      {
-         private GridManager m_GridManager;
- 
          public override bool CanDisguise => true; // Can look like a radar device
  
          public AreaRevealMine(MineData _data, Vector2Int _position) : base(_data, _position)
          {
-             m_GridManager = Object.FindObjectOfType<GridManager>();
          }
  
              
              foreach (var position in positions)
-             {
-                 // Only reveal cells that are within the grid bounds
-                 if (m_GridManager != null && m_GridManager.IsValidPosition(position))
              {
                  GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed(position);
-                 }
              }
          }
```

---

_****_







Now the code is cleaner and should work correctly. Here's what's happening:

1. When the area reveal mine is triggered, it gets the positions to reveal based on its shape and range from `MineShapeHelper`
2. It sends a `CellRevealed` event for each position
3. The `GridManager` receives these events and:
   - Validates if the position is within grid bounds
   - Updates the cell visuals only for valid positions

The mine should now properly reveal cells in a square pattern with the range you specified (3). Any positions that would be outside the grid bounds will be automatically filtered out by the `GridManager`.

Let me know if you're still experiencing any issues!

_**User**_

the realved cell's visual effect should be the same as being clicked

---

_**Assistant**_



Let me check how cell clicking is handled and make sure the reveal effect matches:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Views/CellView.cs

---

_****_



Looking at the code, I can see that both clicking and revealing use the same event system:

1. When a cell is clicked, `OnMouseDown()` raises `GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed()`
2. When the area reveal mine triggers, it also raises `GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed()`
3. Both events are handled by `GridManager.HandleCellRevealed()` which calls `CellView.UpdateVisuals(true)`

So the visual effect should already be the same! The issue might be that we need to also reveal the underlying grid cell. Let me check the `Grid` class:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Core/Grid/Grid.cs

---

_****_



Let me check how `GridManager` handles cell revealing:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Managers/GridManager.cs

---

_****_







I see the issue now. When a cell is revealed, we need to also reveal the underlying grid cell data. Let me modify the `GridManager` to handle this:

---

_****_

```diff
          if (m_Grid.IsValidPosition(position))
          {
+             // Reveal the underlying grid cell
+             m_Grid.GetCell(position).Reveal();
+             
+             // Update the visual representation
              CellView cellView = m_CellObjects[position.x, position.y].GetComponent<CellView>();
              cellView.UpdateVisuals(true);
```

---

_****_







Now the area reveal mine should work exactly like clicking cells:

1. When a cell is revealed (either by clicking or by the area reveal mine):
   - The underlying grid cell data is marked as revealed via `Cell.Reveal()`
   - The visual representation is updated via `CellView.UpdateVisuals(true)`
   - This shows the correct background color, mine sprite (if present), and adjacent mine count

The visual effect should now be identical whether you click a cell or it's revealed by the area reveal mine. Let me know if you're still seeing any differences!

---

_**User**_

I don't understand why it's still not working as expected

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the entire flow of cell revealing to find the issue. First, let me check how the `Cell` class handles revealing:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Core/Grid/Cell.cs

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Core/Mines/AreaRevealMine.cs

---

_****_



I see a potential issue! In the `Cell` class, when we call `Reveal()`, it raises another `CellRevealed` event, which could cause an infinite loop or double-reveal. Here's what's happening:

1. AreaRevealMine triggers and calls `RevealArea()`
2. `RevealArea()` raises `CellRevealed` event for each position
3. `GridManager` handles the event and:
   - Calls `Cell.Reveal()`
   - Which raises another `CellRevealed` event
   - Which triggers `GridManager` again
   - And so on...

Let me fix this by modifying both the `Cell` and `GridManager` classes:

---

_****_

```diff
      public void Reveal()
      {
-         if (!m_IsRevealed)
-         {
          m_IsRevealed = true;
-             GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed(m_Position);
-         }
      }
  
```

---

_****_

```diff
      private bool m_HasMine;
      private MineManager m_MineManager;
+     private bool m_IsRevealed = false;
      #endregion
  
      private void OnMouseDown()
      {
+         // Only raise the event if the cell isn't already revealed
+         if (!m_IsRevealed)
+         {
+             m_IsRevealed = true;
              GameEvents.RaiseCellRevealed(m_Position);
+         }
      }
      #endregion
```

---

_****_

```diff
      public void UpdateVisuals(bool revealed)
      {
+         m_IsRevealed = revealed;
+         
          // Update background
          if (m_BackgroundRenderer != null)
```

---

_****_

```diff
          m_HasMine = false;
          m_MineSprite = null;
+         m_IsRevealed = false;
          
          // Set up initial visuals
```

---

_****_







I've made several changes to fix the cell revealing system:

1. In `Cell.cs`:
   - Removed the event raising from `Reveal()` to prevent infinite loops
   - Now it just sets the revealed state

2. In `CellView.cs`:
   - Added `m_IsRevealed` state tracking
   - Modified `OnMouseDown()` to only raise the event if the cell isn't already revealed
   - Updated `UpdateVisuals()` to track the revealed state
   - Added proper state reset in `Initialize()`

These changes should fix the issues with the area reveal mine:
1. No more infinite loops or double-reveals
2. Cells will only be revealed once
3. The visual state will be properly tracked
4. Clicking already revealed cells won't trigger another reveal

The area reveal mine should now work exactly like clicking cells, with proper visual updates and state tracking. Let me know if you're still seeing any issues!
