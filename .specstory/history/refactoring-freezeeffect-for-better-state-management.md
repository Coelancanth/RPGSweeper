## Refactoring FreezeEffect for Better State Management (2/18/2025, 5:45:01 PM)

_**User**_

first make sure that you follow @Principle.md, then, check the existing state system @Effects, now I would to modify @FreezeEffect.cs, such delegate the handling logic to state system, while freezeEffect simply used to set  the value of the state

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you modify the `FreezeEffect.cs` to better follow the principles and delegate the handling logic to the state system. First, let me analyze the current structure and plan the changes.

Step-by-step plan:
1. Analyze current code against principles:
   - SRP: Currently `FreezeEffect` handles both state and behavior - violates SRP
   - DIP: Direct dependencies on Unity components - should use abstractions
   - ISP: Mixing persistent and triggerable interfaces - could be cleaner

2. Proposed changes:
   - Create a `FrozenState` class to handle the frozen state logic
   - Reduce `FreezeEffect` to just manage state transitions
   - Use dependency injection for grid management
   - Follow proper naming conventions from Principle.md
   - Remove direct MonoBehaviour dependencies

Let me first check the state system to ensure compatibility:

Perfect, I can see the state system implementation. Let me first create a `FrozenState` class to handle the frozen state logic:

I've made the following changes to improve the code according to the principles:

1. Created a new `FrozenState` class that:
   - Inherits from `BaseState`
   - Handles all the frozen state logic
   - Follows proper naming conventions
   - Has clear single responsibility

2. Modified `FreezeEffect` to:
   - Delegate state handling to `FrozenState`
   - Remove direct MonoBehaviour dependencies
   - Use dependency injection for `StateManager`
   - Follow SRP by only managing effect application
   - Remove duplicated code
   - Follow proper naming conventions

The main improvements are:
1. Better separation of concerns (SRP)
2. Proper state management through the state system
3. Reduced coupling between components
4. Cleaner code structure with proper regions
5. Follows naming conventions from Principle.md
6. Removed direct MonoBehaviour dependencies
7. Better error handling and null checks

The new system works by:
1. `FreezeEffect` creates and manages the state transition
2. `FrozenState` handles the actual frozen state logic
3. `StateManager` manages the state lifecycle
4. All state updates are handled automatically by the state system

This implementation better follows the SOLID principles and the code style guidelines from Principle.md. Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?

_**User**_

can you tell me how is "duration" used? right now it turns out to be the "time", but what I want to achieve is "turn"

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check how duration is used in the state system:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Core/States/BaseState.cs

---

_****_



I see the issue. Currently, the state system is using time-based duration (using `deltaTime` in the `Update` method), but you want to use turn-based duration instead. Let me modify the state system to support turn-based duration:

1. First, let's create a new interface for turn-based states:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ using UnityEngine;
+ 
+ namespace RPGMinesweeper.States
+ {
+     public interface ITurnBasedState : IState
+     {
+         int TurnsRemaining { get; }
+         void OnTurnEnd();
+     }
+ } 
```

---

_****_



2. Now, let's create a base class for turn-based states:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ using UnityEngine;
+ 
+ namespace RPGMinesweeper.States
+ {
+     public abstract class BaseTurnState : BaseState, ITurnBasedState
+     {
+         #region Private Fields
+         private int m_TurnsRemaining;
+         #endregion
+ 
+         #region Public Properties
+         public int TurnsRemaining => m_TurnsRemaining;
+         public override bool IsExpired => m_TurnsRemaining <= 0;
+         #endregion
+ 
+         #region Constructor
+         protected BaseTurnState(string name, int turns) : base(name, float.MaxValue)
+         {
+             m_TurnsRemaining = turns;
+         }
+         #endregion
+ 
+         #region Public Methods
+         public override void Update(float deltaTime)
+         {
+             // Do nothing - we don't use time-based updates
+         }
+ 
+         public virtual void OnTurnEnd()
+         {
+             m_TurnsRemaining--;
+         }
+         #endregion
+     }
+ } 
```

---

_****_





3. Now, let's modify the `FrozenState` to use turn-based duration:

---

_****_

```diff
  namespace RPGMinesweeper.States
  {
-     public class FrozenState : BaseState
+     public class FrozenState : BaseTurnState
      {
          #region Private Fields
  
          #region Constructor
-         public FrozenState(int duration, int radius, Vector2Int sourcePosition, GridShape shape = GridShape.Square) 
-             : base("Frozen", duration)
+         public FrozenState(int turns, int radius, Vector2Int sourcePosition, GridShape shape = GridShape.Square) 
+             : base("Frozen", turns)
          {
              m_Radius = radius;
```

---

_****_



4. Finally, let's modify the `StateManager` to handle turn-based states:

---

_****_

```diff
              return m_ActiveStates.ContainsKey(stateName);
          }
+ 
+         public void OnTurnEnd()
+         {
+             List<string> expiredStates = new List<string>();
+             
+             foreach (var state in m_ActiveStates.Values)
+             {
+                 if (state is ITurnBasedState turnState)
+                 {
+                     turnState.OnTurnEnd();
+                     if (turnState.IsExpired)
+                     {
+                         expiredStates.Add(state.Name);
+                     }
+                 }
+             }
+ 
+             foreach (var stateName in expiredStates)
+             {
+                 RemoveState(stateName);
+             }
+         }
          #endregion
  
              
              foreach (var state in m_ActiveStates.Values)
-             {
-                 state.Update(Time.deltaTime);
-                 if (state.IsExpired)
-                 {
-                     expiredStates.Add(state.Name);
+             {
+                 if (!(state is ITurnBasedState)) // Only update time-based states
+                 {
+                     state.Update(Time.deltaTime);
+                     if (state.IsExpired)
+                     {
+                         expiredStates.Add(state.Name);
+                     }
                  }
              }
```

---

_****_



The changes I've made:

1. Created a new `ITurnBasedState` interface that extends `IState` to add turn-based functionality
2. Created a new `BaseTurnState` class that implements turn-based state behavior
3. Modified `FrozenState` to inherit from `BaseTurnState` instead of `BaseState`
4. Added turn-based state handling to `StateManager`

Now the freeze effect will last for a specific number of turns instead of a time duration. The state will be decremented each time `StateManager.OnTurnEnd()` is called, which should be called by your game's turn system.

You'll need to call `StateManager.OnTurnEnd()` whenever a turn ends in your game. This will properly decrement the turns remaining for all turn-based states.

Would you like me to fix the linter errors or explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

---

_**User**_

1. it seems right now there can only be 1 state (if I trigger any other mine with freeze effect)
2. I woule suggest that we create a "targetState" (please think of a better naming, it can be Cell/ Mine/ Global State), back to freezeState, the target should be cell (not interactable) 

---

_**Assistant**_

You make two excellent points. Let me address them:

1. The current implementation replaces states with the same name, which is not what we want for freeze effects. Multiple cells should be able to be frozen independently.

2. We should indeed categorize states by their target type. I'll create an enum and modify the state system to handle this. I'll call it `StateTarget` since it clearly indicates what entity the state affects.

Here's the plan:

1. Create a `StateTarget` enum
2. Modify the state system to track states by both name and target
3. Update `FrozenState` to be cell-specific

Let's implement these changes:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ namespace RPGMinesweeper.States
+ {
+     public enum StateTarget
+     {
+         Global,     // Affects the entire game state
+         Cell,       // Affects a specific cell
+         Mine,       // Affects a specific mine
+         Player      // Affects the player
+     }
+ } 
```

---

_****_



Now, let's modify the `IState` interface to include target information:

---

_****_

```diff
          float Duration { get; }
          bool IsExpired { get; }
+         StateTarget Target { get; }
+         object TargetId { get; } // This will store the specific target identifier (e.g., Vector2Int for cells)
          void Enter(GameObject target);
          void Update(float deltaTime);
```

---

_****_





Now, let's update the `BaseState` to include the new target properties:

---

_****_

```diff
          protected float m_Duration;
          protected string m_Name;
+         protected StateTarget m_Target;
+         protected object m_TargetId;
          #endregion
  
          #region Public Properties
          public string Name => m_Name;
          public float Duration => m_Duration;
-         public virtual bool IsExpired => m_ElapsedTime >= m_Duration;

Now, let's update the `BaseTurnState` to handle the target information:

              m_Radius = radius;
              if (gridManager == null) return;
  
-             var affectedPositions = GridShapeHelper.GetAffectedPositions(m_SourcePosition, m_Shape, Mathf.RoundToInt(m_Radius));
+             var affectedPositions = GridShapeHelper.GetAffectedPositions(m_SourcePosition, m_Shape, m_Radius);
              foreach (var pos in affectedPositions)
              {
              if (gridManager == null) return;

              foreach (var pos in affectedPositions)
              {
```

---

_****_



The changes I've made create a more robust state system that:

1. Supports multiple states with the same name but different targets
2. Properly categorizes states by their target type (Global, Cell, Mine, Player)
3. Makes `FrozenState` cell-specific, using the cell's position as the target ID
4. Allows querying states by target type and ID

The linter errors are due to missing imports of the `StateTarget` enum. We need to fix those in each file. Would you like me to fix the linter errors now?

The key improvements are:
1. Multiple cells can be frozen at the same time
2. Each frozen state is tied to a specific cell
3. States are properly organized by their target type
4. The system is more extensible for future state types

Let me know if you'd like me to:
1. Fix the linter errors
2. Explain any part of the implementation in more detail
3. Make any adjustments to the design

I see that `UnfreezeEffect` should inherit from `BaseEffect` and implement `ITriggerableEffect`. Let me fix the `UnfreezeEffect`:

              EnsureStateManager(target);
```

Now all the linter errors should be fixed. The state system now properly handles:

1. Multiple states with the same name but different targets
2. Cell-specific states using `Vector2Int` as the target ID
3. Turn-based duration for states
4. Proper cleanup of states when they expire or are removed

The key changes were:
1. Fixed `UnfreezeEffect` to use `EffectType.Triggerable` instead of a non-existent `EffectType.Instant`
2. Made `UnfreezeEffect` properly inherit from `BaseEffect`
3. Simplified `UnfreezeEffect` to only handle state removal
4. Ensured proper state target handling in both effects

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The `UnfreezeEffectData` is trying to create an `UnfreezeEffect` with radius and shape parameters, but we've simplified the `UnfreezeEffect` constructor to take no parameters. Let me check the `UnfreezeEffectData` and fix this:

---

_****_

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Core/Effects/UnfreezeEffectData.cs

I see the issue. The `UnfreezeEffect` should still take the radius and shape parameters since it needs to know what area to unfreeze. Let me update both files to be consistent:

---

_****_

```diff
      {
          #region Private Fields
+         private readonly int m_Radius;
+         private readonly GridShape m_Shape;

              m_CurrentMode = EffectType.Triggerable;
          }
          {
              EnsureStateManager(target);

-             if (m_StateManager.HasState("Frozen", StateTarget.Cell, sourcePosition))
+             var affectedPositions = GridShapeHelper.GetAffectedPositions(sourcePosition, m_Shape, m_Radius);
+             
+             foreach (var pos in affectedPositions)
              {

+                 }
              }
          }
```

---

_****_



The changes I've made:

1. Added back the radius and shape parameters to `UnfreezeEffect` constructor
2. Made `UnfreezeEffect` work with an area of effect, just like `FreezeEffect`
3. Removed the unnecessary `m_CurrentPosition` field since we're now handling multiple positions
4. Updated the `ApplyTriggerable` method to unfreeze all cells in the affected area

The key improvements are:
1. Consistency with `FreezeEffect` in terms of area of effect
2. Ability to unfreeze multiple cells at once
3. Proper use of the shape and radius parameters from the effect data

This makes more sense because:
1. If a freeze effect can freeze an area, the unfreeze effect should be able to unfreeze an area
2. This gives more strategic options to the player
3. It maintains consistency in how area effects work in the game

The `UnfreezeEffectData` should now work correctly since it's passing the radius and shape parameters that the `UnfreezeEffect` constructor expects.

_**User**_

but @UnfreezeEffect.cs seems not working, there is also no debug.info output in the console

_**Assistant**_

Let me help debug this. There could be a few reasons why the UnfreezeEffect is not working:

1. Let's first check if the StateManager is being found correctly
2. We should verify if the state exists in the correct StateManager
3. We need to make sure we're using the correct target GameObject

Let me add more detailed logging to help diagnose the issue:

Let me also check how the FreezeEffect is applying its state to make sure we're looking in the right place:

I see a potential issue. The `FreezeEffect` and `UnfreezeEffect` might be using different `StateManager` instances. The `FreezeEffect` stores its state on the target GameObject, but we need to make sure both effects are using the same target GameObject.

Let me modify the `UnfreezeEffect` to be more consistent with how `FreezeEffect` works:

The key changes I've made:

1. Instead of using a single StateManager from the target GameObject, we now:
   - Get the GridManager to find cell objects
   - Look for StateManager components on each individual cell
   - This matches how FreezeEffect works, as it applies states to individual cells

2. Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues:
   - Logs when cell objects are found/not found
   - Logs when StateManagers are found/not found
   - Logs the state checking and removal process

The issue was likely that we were looking for states in the wrong place. The `FreezeEffect` applies states to individual cell objects, but we were trying to find and remove them from a single StateManager on the target object.

Now the `UnfreezeEffect` should:
1. Find all cells in the affected area
2. Check each cell for a StateManager
3. Remove the frozen state from each cell that has it

Please try it now and let me know if you see the debug logs in the console. If it's still not working, the logs should help us identify exactly where the problem is.

Ah, I see the issue. The log shows that the UnfreezeEffect is being created when a mine is being destroyed (`MonsterMine:OnDestroy`), but we don't see any of the logs from `ApplyTriggerable`, which means the effect is not being applied.

Let me check how the effect is being applied in the `MonsterMine` class:

I see the issue. The UnfreezeEffect is being created but not properly applied because:

1. The effect is created in `MonsterMine.OnDestroy()`
2. It's trying to apply the effect to the player GameObject
3. But the FreezeEffect applies its state to the cell objects, not the player

Let me modify the UnfreezeEffect to be consistent with how we're applying it:

---

          private readonly int m_Radius;
          private readonly GridShape m_Shape;

          protected override void ApplyTriggerable(GameObject target, Vector2Int sourcePosition)
          {

                  if (stateManager == null)
                  {

+                     stateManager = cellObject.AddComponent<StateManager>();
                  }
  
                      stateManager.RemoveState(("Frozen", StateTarget.Cell, pos));
                  }

              }

The key changes I've made:

1. Removed the unnecessary `m_StateManager` field since we're working with individual cell StateManagers
2. Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues
3. Added automatic creation of StateManager components if they don't exist (like FreezeEffect does)
4. Added logging when no Frozen state is found

Now let me check how the FreezeEffect is being applied to make sure we're looking in the right place:

I see one more potential issue - we need to make sure we're looking for the frozen state on the correct GameObject. The FrozenState applies its effect to individual cell objects, and we need to make sure we're checking the same objects.

Let me add one more debug log to help track this:

---

_****_

```diff
  
                  Debug.Log($"Found cell object at {pos}: {cellObject.name}");
+                 var cellView = cellObject.GetComponent<CellView>();
+                 if (cellView != null)
+                 {
+                     Debug.Log($"Found CellView at {pos}, current frozen state: {cellView.IsFrozen}");
+                 }
+ 
                  var stateManager = cellObject.GetComponent<StateManager>();
                  if (stateManager == null)
```

Let me check the CellView class to see the correct property name:

I see that CellView has a private `m_IsFrozen` field and a `SetFrozen` method. Let me update the UnfreezeEffect to use the correct property:

---

```diff
  using RPGMinesweeper.Grid;
  using RPGMinesweeper.States;
+ using System.Reflection;
  
  namespace RPGMinesweeper.Effects
                  if (cellView != null)
                  {
-                     Debug.Log($"Found CellView at {pos}, current frozen state: {cellView.IsFrozen}");
+                     var frozenField = cellView.GetType().GetField("m_IsFrozen", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
+                     bool isFrozen = (bool)frozenField.GetValue(cellView);
+                     Debug.Log($"Found CellView at {pos}, current frozen state: {isFrozen}");
                  }
  
                      Debug.Log($"Removing Frozen state at position: {pos}");
                      stateManager.RemoveState(("Frozen", StateTarget.Cell, pos));

+                         cellView.SetFrozen(false);
+                     }
                  }
                  else
```

I've made two important changes:

1. Added reflection to properly read the private `m_IsFrozen` field for debugging
2. Added a call to `SetFrozen(false)` on the CellView when removing the frozen state

The key issue I found is that we need to both:
1. Remove the state from the StateManager
2. Update the CellView's frozen state

This is because the FrozenState applies its effect in two places:
1. It adds a state to the StateManager
2. It calls `SetFrozen(true)` on the CellView

So our UnfreezeEffect needs to undo both of these changes. Now it should properly unfreeze cells. Please try it again and let me know if you see the debug logs in the console and if the unfreezing works correctly.
