## Creating Targeted Reveal Effect for Mines (2/15/2025, 10:09:49 PM)

_**User**_

Now besides @RevealEffect.cs , I would like to create another "revealEffect" that instead reveal cells in the range, but reveal certain target (a concrete mine type, for example, a bat monster mine)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a targeted reveal effect. Let's call it `TargetedRevealEffect` that specifically reveals only certain types of mines within a radius.

Let me plan this out:

1. Create a new class `TargetedRevealEffect` that implements `IEffect`
2. It will need:
   - Duration and radius like RevealEffect
   - Target mine type to reveal
   - Same core structure but with filtering logic
3. Key differences from RevealEffect:
   - Will only reveal cells containing the specified mine type
   - Other cells in range will remain hidden
   - Need to check mine type before revealing

Let me implement this:

---

```diff
  using UnityEngine;
+ using RPGMinesweeper.Effects;
  
  namespace RPGMinesweeper.Effects
          private readonly float m_Duration;
          private readonly float m_Radius;
-         private readonly MineType m_TargetMineType;
-         private readonly MonsterType m_TargetMonsterType;
+         private readonly System.Type m_TargetMineType;
  
          public EffectType Type => EffectType.Reveal;
          public EffectTargetType TargetType => EffectTargetType.Grid;
          public float Duration => m_Duration;
  
-         public TargetedRevealEffect(float duration, float radius, MineType targetMineType, MonsterType targetMonsterType = MonsterType.None)
+         public TargetedRevealEffect(float duration, float radius, System.Type targetMineType)
          {
              m_Duration = duration;
              m_Radius = radius;
              m_TargetMineType = targetMineType;
-             m_TargetMonsterType = targetMonsterType;
          }
  
                      if (gridManager.IsValidPosition(pos))
                      {
-                         // Only reveal if there's a matching mine
-                         if (mineManager.HasMineAt(pos))
-                         {
-                             var mine = mineManager.GetMines()[pos];
-                             if (mine != null && mine.Type == m_TargetMineType)
-                             {
-                                 // For monster mines, check specific monster type if specified
-                                 if (m_TargetMineType == MineType.Monster && m_TargetMonsterType != MonsterType.None)
-                                 {
-                                     var monsterMine = mine as MonsterMine;
-                                     if (monsterMine == null || monsterMine.MonsterType != m_TargetMonsterType)
-                                     {
-                                         continue;
-                                     }
-                                 }
- 
-                                 var cellObject = gridManager.GetCellObject(pos);
+                         var cellObject = gridManager.GetCellObject(pos);
                          if (cellObject != null)
                          {
                              var cellView = cellObject.GetComponent<CellView>();
-                                     if (cellView != null)
+                             if (cellView != null && mineManager.HasMineAt(pos))
                              {
-                                         // Show the mine sprite first
+                                 var mine = mineManager.GetMines()[pos];
+                                 // Only reveal if the mine matches our target type
+                                 if (mine.GetType() == m_TargetMineType)
+                                 {
                                      var mineData = mineManager.GetMineDataAt(pos);
                                      if (mineData != null)
                                      {
                                          cellView.ShowMineSprite(mineData.MineSprite, mine, mineData);
-                                         }
-                                         // Then reveal the cell
                                          cellView.UpdateVisuals(true);
                                      }
```

I've created a new `TargetedRevealEffect` class that selectively reveals only mines of a specific type within a given radius. Here's how it works:

1. Takes three parameters in the constructor:
   - `duration`: How long the effect lasts
   - `radius`: The area of effect
   - `targetMineType`: The specific type of mine to reveal (e.g., `typeof(MonsterMine)`)

2. The `Apply` method:
   - Checks cells within the radius
   - Only reveals cells that contain mines matching the target type
   - Shows both the mine sprite and updates the cell visuals for matching mines

To use this effect, you can create it like this:
```csharp
// To reveal only MonsterMines in a radius of 3 for 5 seconds
var effect = new TargetedRevealEffect(5f, 3f, typeof(MonsterMine));

// To reveal only standard mines
var effect = new TargetedRevealEffect(5f, 3f, typeof(StandardMine));
```

The key difference from the regular `RevealEffect` is that this one only reveals specific types of mines while leaving other cells (even those with different mine types) hidden. This can be useful for:
- Revealing specific threats
- Strategic information gathering
- Monster-specific detection abilities

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

---

_**User**_

this should be more specific, like target a bat (monster type) mine (mine type) 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, you're right. We should make it more specific to target monster mines by their monster type. Let me modify the `TargetedRevealEffect` to handle this:

Let me search for the `MonsterType` enum since I see it's not in the current code:

---

_****_



---

_****_



I need to create the `MonsterType` enum first. Let me create it:

---

_****_

```diff
- namespace RPGMinesweeper
+ namespace RPGMinesweeper.Mines
  {
      public enum MonsterType
      {
-         None = 0,
+         None,
          Bat,
-         Slime,
-         Goblin,
          Spider,
-         Ghost
+         Slime,
+         Ghost,
+         Skeleton,
+         Dragon
      }
  } 
```

---

_****_



Now I need to update the `MonsterMine` class to include the `MonsterType`:

---

_****_

```diff
  using RPGMinesweeper.Effects;
  using RPGMinesweeper.Grid;
+ using RPGMinesweeper.Mines;
  
  public class MonsterMine : IDamagingMine
      public Color MonsterTint => m_MonsterTint;
      public bool IsCollectable => m_CurrentHp <= 0;
+     public MonsterType MonsterType => m_Data.MonsterType;
      
      // Modifiable properties
```

---

_****_





Finally, I need to update the `MonsterMineData` to include the `MonsterType`:

---

_****_

```diff
  using UnityEngine;
+ using RPGMinesweeper.Mines;
  
  [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "MonsterMineData", menuName = "RPGMinesweeper/MonsterMineData")]
  public class MonsterMineData : MineData
  {
      [Header("Monster Properties")]
+     [Tooltip("Type of monster this mine represents")]
+     [SerializeField] private MonsterType m_MonsterType = MonsterType.None;
+     
      [Tooltip("Maximum HP of the monster - determines how many hits it can take before being defeated")]
      [SerializeField] private int m_MaxHp = 100;
      [SerializeField, Range(1f, 3f)] private float m_EnrageDamageMultiplier = 1.5f;
  
+     public MonsterType MonsterType => m_MonsterType;
      public int MaxHp => m_MaxHp;
      public int BaseDamage => m_BaseDamage;
```

---

_****_



The linter errors are because we need to make sure the namespace is correct. Let me fix the namespace in the MonsterType enum:

---

_****_

```diff
- namespace RPGMinesweeper.Mines
+ namespace RPGMinesweeper
  {
      public enum MonsterType
```

---

_****_





Now I need to update the imports in the affected files:

---

_****_



---

_****_



---

_****_



---

_****_



Now the targeted reveal effect is set up to specifically reveal monster mines of a certain type (like bats). You can use it like this:

```csharp
// Create an effect that reveals only bat monsters within a radius of 3 for 5 seconds
var effect = new TargetedRevealEffect(5f, 3f, MonsterType.Bat);
```

This will:
1. Only reveal monster mines that are of type `MonsterType.Bat`
2. Show their sprites and update cell visuals
3. Leave all other cells (including other monster types) hidden
4. Work within the specified radius from the source position

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

---

_**Assistant**_

The errors are because we need to fix the namespace references. The issue is that some files are trying to use `RPGMinesweeper.Mines` namespace but our `MonsterType` enum is in the root `RPGMinesweeper` namespace. Let's fix this:

1. First, let's update the imports in MonsterMine.cs:

---

_****_



---

_****_



2. Let's update MonsterMineData.cs:

---

_****_

```diff
  using UnityEngine;
- using RPGMinesweeper.Mines;
+ using RPGMinesweeper;  // For MonsterType
  
  [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "MonsterMineData", menuName = "RPGMinesweeper/MonsterMineData")]
```

---

_****_





3. Let's update TargetedRevealEffect.cs to make sure it has the correct import:

---

_****_

```diff
  using UnityEngine;
  using RPGMinesweeper.Effects;
+ using RPGMinesweeper;  // For MonsterType
  
  namespace RPGMinesweeper.Effects
```

---

_****_



These changes should resolve the namespace errors. We:
1. Updated MonsterMineData.cs to use the correct namespace for MonsterType
2. Updated TargetedRevealEffect.cs to import the MonsterType enum
3. The MonsterType enum remains in the root RPGMinesweeper namespace which is correct

All the files should now be able to properly reference the MonsterType enum. Let me know if you see any other errors!

---

_**User**_

Assets\Scripts\Core\Mines\MonsterMine.cs(5,22): error CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Mines' does not exist in the namespace 'RPGMinesweeper' (are you missing an assembly reference?)

Assets\Scripts\Core\Mines\MonsterMine.cs(37,12): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'MonsterType' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)



---

_**Assistant**_

Let's fix the remaining errors in MonsterMine.cs. The issue is that we still have the incorrect namespace import and we need to add the MonsterType import:

---

_****_

```diff
  using RPGMinesweeper.Effects;
  using RPGMinesweeper.Grid;
- using RPGMinesweeper.Mines;
+ using RPGMinesweeper;  // For MonsterType
  
  public class MonsterMine : IDamagingMine
```

---

_****_



This change should resolve both errors by:
1. Removing the non-existent `RPGMinesweeper.Mines` namespace import
2. Adding the correct `RPGMinesweeper` namespace import that contains the `MonsterType` enum

Now MonsterMine.cs should be able to properly reference the MonsterType enum. Let me know if you see any other errors!

---

_**User**_

but how to use the targetedReveal? how to set it up?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me show you how to set up and use the TargetedRevealEffect. We should create an EffectData class for it, similar to how other effects are structured in the system.

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ using UnityEngine;
+ using RPGMinesweeper.Effects;
+ using RPGMinesweeper;
+ 
+ [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "TargetedRevealEffectData", menuName = "RPGMinesweeper/Effects/TargetedRevealEffect")]
+ public class TargetedRevealEffectData : EffectData
+ {
+     [Header("Targeted Reveal Properties")]
+     [Tooltip("Duration of the reveal effect")]
+     [SerializeField] private float m_Duration = 5f;
+ 
+     [Tooltip("Radius of the reveal effect")]
+     [SerializeField] private float m_Radius = 3f;
+ 
+     [Tooltip("Type of monster to reveal")]
+     [SerializeField] private MonsterType m_TargetMonsterType = MonsterType.None;
+ 
+     public override IEffect CreateEffect()
+     {
+         return new TargetedRevealEffect(m_Duration, m_Radius, m_TargetMonsterType);
+     }
+ } 
```

---

_****_



Now you can use the TargetedRevealEffect in several ways:

1. As a ScriptableObject (recommended way):
```csharp
// In Unity Editor:
// 1. Right click in Project window
// 2. Create -> RPGMinesweeper -> Effects -> TargetedRevealEffect
// 3. Configure in Inspector: set duration, radius, and target monster type
// 4. Assign to MonsterMineData's ActiveEffects or PassiveEffects
```

2. Through code:
```csharp
// Create the effect directly
var effect = new TargetedRevealEffect(
    duration: 5f,          // Effect lasts 5 seconds
    radius: 3f,            // Reveals in a 3-cell radius
    targetMonsterType: MonsterType.Bat  // Only reveals Bat monsters
);

// Apply the effect
effect.Apply(sourceGameObject, sourcePosition);
```

3. As part of a mine's effects:
```csharp
// In MonsterMineData inspector:
// 1. Add a new effect in ActiveEffects or PassiveEffects array
// 2. Assign a TargetedRevealEffectData asset
// 3. Configure the parameters

// The effect will automatically be created and applied when:
// - ActiveEffects: When the mine is destroyed
// - PassiveEffects: While the mine exists
```

Common use cases:
1. Create a "Bat Detector" mine that reveals nearby bat monsters when triggered
2. Create a "Ghost Sensor" item that periodically reveals nearby ghost monsters
3. Create a "Dragon Radar" effect that reveals dragon monsters in a large radius

For example, to create a Bat Detector mine:
1. Create a new MonsterMineData
2. In its ActiveEffects, add a TargetedRevealEffectData
3. Configure the TargetedRevealEffectData:
   - Duration: How long the reveal lasts
   - Radius: How far it can detect
   - TargetMonsterType: Set to Bat
4. When this mine is triggered, it will reveal all bat monsters in range

Would you like me to show you how to set up any specific use case?

_**User**_

it didn't work, but @RevealEffect.cs works though...

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the RevealEffect.cs to see what might be missing:

Read file: Assets/Scripts/Core/Effects/RevealEffect.cs

Let me check if we have a RevealEffectData as well:

I see the issue! Looking at EffectData.cs, we need to register our TargetedRevealEffect in the ActiveEffectData's CreateEffect method. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
      public class ActiveEffectData : EffectData
      {
+         [Header("Monster Targeting")]
+         [Tooltip("For TargetedReveal effect, specify which monster type to reveal")]
+         [SerializeField] private MonsterType m_TargetMonsterType = MonsterType.None;
+ 
          public override IEffect CreateEffect()
          {
                  case EffectType.Reveal:
                      return new RevealEffect(Duration, Radius);
+                 case EffectType.TargetedReveal:
+                     return new TargetedRevealEffect(Duration, Radius, m_TargetMonsterType);
                  default:
                      Debug.LogWarning($"Effect type {Type} not implemented as active effect");
```

---

_****_





Now you can use the TargetedRevealEffect in two ways:

1. Using the ActiveEffectData in Unity Editor:
   - Create a new ActiveEffect asset (Right click -> Create -> RPGMinesweeper -> Effects -> ActiveEffect)
   - Set its Type to `TargetedReveal`
   - Configure Duration and Radius
   - Set the TargetMonsterType (e.g., Bat, Spider, etc.)
   - Assign this ActiveEffect to a mine's ActiveEffects array

2. Using it in code:
```csharp
var effect = new TargetedRevealEffect(
    duration: 5f,
    radius: 3f,
    targetMonsterType: MonsterType.Bat
);
effect.Apply(gameObject, position);
```

For example, to create a Bat Detector mine:
1. Create a new MonsterMineData asset
2. In its ActiveEffects array, add a new ActiveEffect
3. Configure the ActiveEffect:
   - Set Type to TargetedReveal
   - Set Duration (e.g., 5 seconds)
   - Set Radius (e.g., 3 cells)
   - Set TargetMonsterType to Bat
4. When this mine is triggered, it will reveal only bat monsters in the radius

The key difference from before is that we've properly integrated it into the effect system by:
1. Adding it to the ActiveEffectData class
2. Making it available through the standard effect creation system
3. Making it configurable in the Unity Inspector

Try creating an ActiveEffect asset with Type set to TargetedReveal and it should work now!

why target is "None"? I set it to "bat"

_**Assistant**_

The issue is that we're using two different data assets - the TargetedRevealEffectData and ActiveEffectData - but we're not properly transferring the monster type value between them. Let me fix this:

1. First, let's check if we're using the right effect data class. Looking at your screenshot, you're using `TargetedRevealEffectData`, but in our code we're handling it in `ActiveEffectData`. Let's modify the `TargetedRevealEffectData` to properly create the effect:

---

_****_

```diff
      public override IEffect CreateEffect()
      {
+         Debug.Log($"Creating TargetedRevealEffect with monster type: {m_TargetMonsterType}");
          return new TargetedRevealEffect(m_Duration, m_Radius, m_TargetMonsterType);
      }
```

---

_****_



2. Let's also add more debug logging to the TargetedRevealEffect to help us track what's happening:

---

_****_

```diff
              m_Radius = radius;
              m_TargetMonsterType = targetMonsterType;
+             Debug.Log($"TargetedRevealEffect created with monster type: {targetMonsterType}");
          }
  
          public void Apply(GameObject source, Vector2Int sourcePosition)
          {
-             //Debug.Log("TargetedRevealEffect applied");
+             Debug.Log($"TargetedRevealEffect.Apply - Looking for monster type: {m_TargetMonsterType}");
              var gridManager = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<GridManager>();
              var mineManager = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<MineManager>();
                              {
                                  var mine = mineManager.GetMines()[pos];
-                                 //Debug.Log("mine: " + mine.GetType() + " pos: " + pos);
-                                 // Check if it's a monster mine and matches our target monster type
-                                 Debug.Log("target: " + m_TargetMonsterType);
-                                 if (mine is MonsterMine monsterMine && monsterMine.MonsterType == m_TargetMonsterType)
+                                 if (mine is MonsterMine monsterMine)
                                  {
+                                     Debug.Log($"Found monster mine at {pos} with type: {monsterMine.MonsterType}");
+                                     if (monsterMine.MonsterType == m_TargetMonsterType)
+                                     {
+                                         Debug.Log($"Revealing monster mine at {pos}");
                                          var mineData = mineManager.GetMineDataAt(pos);
                                          if (mineData != null)
                                          {
                                              cellView.ShowMineSprite(mineData.MineSprite, mine, mineData);
                                              cellView.UpdateVisuals(true);
+                                         }
                                      }
                                  }
```

The issue might be that you're using the wrong effect data type. In your screenshot, I see you're using a `TargetedRevealEffectData` asset, but we also have the monster type setting in `ActiveEffectData`. This could be causing confusion.

You should:

1. Delete any existing effect data assets you have for this effect
2. Create a new effect data asset by right-clicking in the Project window and selecting:
   Create -> RPGMinesweeper -> Effects -> TargetedRevealEffect

Then configure it with:
- Duration: 5
- Radius: 13 (as in your screenshot)
- Target Monster Type: Bat

The debug logs I've added will help us track:
1. What monster type the effect is created with
2. What monster type it's looking for when applied
3. What monster types it finds in the grid
4. When it successfully reveals a monster

Try this and let me know what the debug logs show. This will help us pinpoint exactly where the monster type is being lost.

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes! I see the issue now. Looking at MineData.cs, in the `EffectTemplate.CreateInstance()` method, we're only copying the base EffectData properties but not the specific properties of TargetedRevealEffectData. We need to add support for copying the monster type.

Let's modify the EffectTemplate class:

---

_****_

```diff
      [SerializeField] private int m_Radius = 1;
      [SerializeField] private LayerMask m_TargetLayers;
+     [SerializeField] private MonsterType m_TargetMonsterType = MonsterType.None;
  
      // For passive effects
              passiveInstance.TickInterval = m_TickInterval;
          }
+         else if (instance is TargetedRevealEffectData targetedRevealInstance)
+         {
+             targetedRevealInstance.SetTargetMonsterType(m_TargetMonsterType);
+         }
  
          return instance;
                  if (m_TickInterval == 1f) m_TickInterval = passiveTemplate.TickInterval;
              }
+             else if (m_Template is TargetedRevealEffectData targetedRevealTemplate)
+             {
+                 if (m_TargetMonsterType == MonsterType.None) m_TargetMonsterType = targetedRevealTemplate.GetTargetMonsterType();
+             }
          }
      }
```

---

_****_



Let's fix the linter errors. First, we need to add the MonsterType import and add the getter/setter methods to TargetedRevealEffectData:

---

_****_

```diff
  using RPGMinesweeper.Effects;
  using RPGMinesweeper.Grid;
+ using RPGMinesweeper;  // For MonsterType
  
  [Serializable]
```

---

_****_





Now let's add the getter/setter methods to TargetedRevealEffectData:

---

_****_

```diff
      [Tooltip("Type of monster to reveal")]
      [SerializeField] private MonsterType m_TargetMonsterType = MonsterType.None;
+ 
+     public void SetTargetMonsterType(MonsterType type)
+     {
+         m_TargetMonsterType = type;
+     }
+ 
+     public MonsterType GetTargetMonsterType()
+     {
+         return m_TargetMonsterType;
+     }
  
      public override IEffect CreateEffect()
```

---

_****_





Now the system should work correctly. Here's what's happening:

1. When you create an EffectTemplate in the inspector and assign a TargetedRevealEffectData as the template:
   - You can set the target monster type in the EffectTemplate's properties
   - This value will be copied to the actual effect instance when CreateInstance() is called

2. The flow is:
   ```
   EffectTemplate (m_TargetMonsterType = Bat)
   â†“
   CreateInstance()
   â†“
   Sets the monster type on TargetedRevealEffectData
   â†“
   CreateEffect() creates TargetedRevealEffect with the correct monster type
   ```

To use it:
1. Create a TargetedRevealEffectData asset
2. In your mine's ActiveEffects or PassiveEffects array:
   - Add a new element
   - Assign the TargetedRevealEffectData as the Template
   - Set the Target Monster Type to Bat (or whatever monster you want to reveal)
   - Set other properties like Duration and Radius

The debug logs should now show the correct monster type being passed through the system. Try it and let me know if it works!

_**User**_

Radius: 3
UnityEngine.Debug:Log (object)
RPGMinesweeper.Effects.TargetedRevealEffect:Apply (UnityEngine.GameObject,UnityEngine.Vector2Int) (at Assets/Scripts/Core/Effects/TargetedRevealEffect.cs:37)
MonsterMine:OnDestroy () (at Assets/Scripts/Core/Mines/MonsterMine.cs:170)
MineManager:HandleMineRemoval (UnityEngine.Vector2Int) (at Assets/Scripts/Managers/MineManager.cs:133)
GameEvents:RaiseMineRemovalAttempted (UnityEngine.Vector2Int) (at Assets/Scripts/Core/Events/GameEvents.cs:35)
CellView:OnMouseDown () (at Assets/Scripts/Views/CellView.cs:316)
UnityEngine.SendMouseEvents:DoSendMouseEvents (int)

why radius is 3? I set it to "13" 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue! In the `EffectTemplate.CreateInstance()` method in MineData.cs, we're copying the radius as an integer to the base EffectData properties, but in TargetedRevealEffectData we're using a float for radius. Let's fix this:

---

_****_

```diff
      [Tooltip("Duration of the reveal effect")]
      [SerializeField] private float m_Duration = 5f;
- 
-     [Tooltip("Radius of the reveal effect")]
-     [SerializeField] private float m_Radius = 3f;
  
      [Tooltip("Type of monster to reveal")]
      public override IEffect CreateEffect()
      {
-         Debug.Log($"Creating TargetedRevealEffect with monster type: {m_TargetMonsterType}");
-         return new TargetedRevealEffect(m_Duration, m_Radius, m_TargetMonsterType);
+         Debug.Log($"Creating TargetedRevealEffect with monster type: {m_TargetMonsterType} and radius: {Radius}");
+         return new TargetedRevealEffect(Duration, Radius, m_TargetMonsterType);
      }
  } 
```

---

_****_



The issue was that we had two different radius values:
1. The base `Radius` property from `EffectData` (which is getting set to 13 from your template)
2. A local `m_Radius` field in `TargetedRevealEffectData` that was defaulting to 3

I've modified the code to:
1. Remove the duplicate radius field from `TargetedRevealEffectData`
2. Use the base class's `Duration` and `Radius` properties
3. Added more debug logging to verify the radius value

Now when you set the radius to 13 in the template, it should properly pass through to the effect. Try it again and let me know if the radius is correct now!

_**User**_

@generate git commit etc. 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help generate the commit message and update the documentation based on the changes.

1. First, let's create the commit message:

```
feat: Add targeted reveal effect for specific monster types

Implement a new TargetedRevealEffect system that can reveal specific monster types 
(e.g., bats, spiders) within a configurable radius. This enhances strategic 
gameplay by allowing selective monster detection.

- Add TargetedRevealEffect and TargetedRevealEffectData classes
- Create MonsterType enum for monster type classification
- Enhance EffectTemplate to support monster type targeting
- Fix radius value propagation from template to effect instance
```

2. Let's update the Changelog.md by adding a new entry at the top:

---

_****_

These updates:
1. Create a clear commit message explaining the new feature and its implementation
2. Add a detailed changelog entry with diagrams showing the new effect system
3. Update the architecture documentation to include the targeted reveal effect in the effect system hierarchy

The documentation now properly reflects the new targeted reveal effect system and its integration with the existing effect framework. Would you like me to make any adjustments to these changes?

_**User**_

now I would to create a new "shape" which affect the whole grid. (please note how to properply use range)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add a new "Whole Grid" shape to the `GridShape` enum and implement the necessary logic in `GridShapeHelper`. Let me first check the current implementation.

Let me add a new "WholeGrid" shape to the `GridShape` enum and implement its logic in `GridShapeHelper`. First, I'll edit the `GridShape.cs` file:

---

_****_

```diff
          Square,     // Square shape
          Diamond,    // Diamond shape
-         Line        // Straight line
+         Line,       // Straight line
+         WholeGrid   // Affects entire grid
      }
  } 
```

---

_****_



Now, I'll update the `GridShapeHelper.cs` to implement the logic for the WholeGrid shape:

---

_****_

```diff
                      }
                      break;
+ 
+                 case GridShape.WholeGrid:

                  default:

I've added the new `WholeGrid` shape with the following characteristics:

1. In `GetAffectedPositions`:
   - For `WholeGrid`, the range parameter is ignored since it affects the entire grid
   - It gets the actual grid dimensions from `GridManager` and returns all valid positions
   - This ensures the effect will work with any grid size

2. In `IsPositionAffected`:
   - For `WholeGrid`, it simply checks if the position is within the grid bounds
   - Uses `GridManager.IsValidPosition` to ensure consistency with grid boundaries
   - This makes it efficient for position checks

When using the `WholeGrid` shape, keep these points in mind:
1. The `range` parameter is ignored since it affects the entire grid
2. The effect will automatically adapt to any grid size
3. It's more performance-intensive than other shapes since it affects all cells
4. Best used for global effects like revealing all monsters of a type or applying confusion to the entire grid

Example usage in an effect:
```csharp
// Create an effect that reveals all cells
var effect = new RevealEffect(duration: 5f, radius: 0);  // radius is ignored for WholeGrid
effectData.Shape = GridShape.WholeGrid;

// Create a confusion effect that affects the whole grid
var confusionEffect = new ConfusionEffect(duration: 10f, radius: 0, shape: GridShape.WholeGrid);
```

Would you like me to show you an example of how to use this new shape in a specific effect?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help generate the Git commit, changelog entry, and architecture update based on the changes we made to add the WholeGrid shape.

1. Git Commit:
```
feat: Add WholeGrid shape for grid-wide effects

Implement a new WholeGrid shape that affects the entire grid regardless of range.
This enhances the effect system by allowing effects to target all cells at once,
useful for global reveal or confusion effects.

- Add WholeGrid to GridShape enum
- Implement GetAffectedPositions for WholeGrid using actual grid dimensions
- Add IsPositionAffected support for grid-wide position checks
- Optimize position checks by using GridManager's IsValidPosition
```

I see the issue. The `TargetedRevealEffect` is not using the `GridShapeHelper` to get affected positions. Instead, it's using a manual loop with radius. Let me fix this by updating the `TargetedRevealEffect` to properly use the shape system:

---

_****_

```diff

+

                  if (gridManager.IsValidPosition(pos))
                  {
                              if (mine is MonsterMine monsterMine)
                              {
-                                     //Debug.Log($"Found monster mine at {pos} with type: {monsterMine.MonsterType}");
                                  if (monsterMine.MonsterType == m_TargetMonsterType)
                                  {
-                                         //Debug.Log($"Revealing monster mine at {pos}");
                                      var mineData = mineManager.GetMineDataAt(pos);
                                      if (mineData != null)
                                      {
                                          cellView.ShowMineSprite(mineData.MineSprite, mine, mineData);
                                          cellView.UpdateVisuals(true);
-                                         }
                                      }
                                  }
```

Now I need to update the `TargetedRevealEffectData` to pass the shape to the effect:

---

_****_

```diff
      public override IEffect CreateEffect()
      {
-         Debug.Log($"Creating TargetedRevealEffect with monster type: {m_TargetMonsterType} and radius: {Radius}");
-         return new TargetedRevealEffect(Duration, Radius, m_TargetMonsterType);
+         Debug.Log($"Creating TargetedRevealEffect with monster type: {m_TargetMonsterType}, shape: {Shape}, radius: {Radius}");
+         return new TargetedRevealEffect(Duration, Radius, m_TargetMonsterType, Shape);
      }
  } 
```

---

_****_



I've made the following changes to fix the WholeGrid shape support in TargetedRevealEffect:

1. Added proper GridShape support to TargetedRevealEffect:
   - Added a `m_Shape` field to store the shape
   - Updated constructor to accept a shape parameter
   - Added more detailed debug logging

2. Changed position calculation to use GridShapeHelper:
   - Replaced manual radius-based loops with `GetAffectedPositions`
   - Added proper shape-based position calculation
   - Added logging to track affected positions

3. Updated TargetedRevealEffectData:
   - Modified `CreateEffect` to pass the shape to the effect
   - Enhanced debug logging to include shape information

Now the WholeGrid shape should work properly with TargetedRevealEffect. When you set the shape to WholeGrid in the effect data:
1. It will properly scan the entire grid for monsters
2. The radius parameter will be ignored (as per WholeGrid behavior)
3. It will still only reveal monsters of the specified type

You can test this by:
1. Creating a TargetedRevealEffectData
2. Setting its Shape to WholeGrid
3. Setting the TargetMonsterType to the desired type (e.g., Bat)
4. The effect should now reveal all monsters of that type across the entire grid

Would you like me to add any additional debug logging or make any other adjustments?

_**User**_

can you also add the row and column to @GridShape.cs, and modify all releated files

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add Row and Column shapes to the GridShape enum and update the GridShapeHelper to support them.

First, let's update the GridShape enum:

---

_****_

```diff
          Diamond,    // Diamond shape
          Line,       // Straight line
-         WholeGrid   // Affects entire grid
+         WholeGrid,  // Affects entire grid
+         Row,        // Affects entire row
+         Column      // Affects entire column
      }
  } 
```

---

_****_



Now, let's update the GridShapeHelper to handle Row and Column shapes:

---

_****_

```diff
          {
              var positions = new List<Vector2Int>();

              switch (shape)
  
                  case GridShape.WholeGrid:
-                     var gridManager = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<GridManager>();
                      if (gridManager != null)
                      {
                      }
                      break;
-             }
-             //Debug.Log($"MineShapeHelper: Shape {shape} with range {range} has {positions.Count} positions");
+ 
+                 case GridShape.Row:
+                     if (gridManager != null)
+                     {

+                             positions.Add(new Vector2Int(x, center.y));
+                         }
+                     }
+                     break;
+ 
+                 case GridShape.Column:
+                     if (gridManager != null)
+                     {
+                         // For Column, affect the entire column at center.x
+                         for (int y = 0; y < gridManager.Height; y++)
+                         {
+                             positions.Add(new Vector2Int(center.x, y));
+                         }
+                     }

+             Debug.Log($"GridShapeHelper: Shape {shape} with range {range} has {positions.Count} positions");
              return positions;
          }
          
          public static bool IsPositionAffected(Vector2Int position, Vector2Int center, GridShape shape, int range)
          {
+             var gridManager = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<GridManager>();
+             
              switch (shape)
              {
  
                  case GridShape.WholeGrid:
-                     var gridManager = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<GridManager>();
                      if (gridManager != null)
                      {
                      }
                      return false;

+                     }
+                     return false;
                      
                  default:
```

Let me also update the Architecture documentation to reflect these changes:

I've made the following changes to add Row and Column shapes:

1. Updated GridShape enum:
   - Added Row shape for affecting entire rows
   - Added Column shape for affecting entire columns
   - Both shapes ignore the range parameter like WholeGrid

2. Enhanced GridShapeHelper:
   - Added Row shape implementation to affect all cells in a row
   - Added Column shape implementation to affect all cells in a column
   - Both use GridManager to get proper grid dimensions
   - Added boundary checking for both shapes

3. Updated documentation:
   - Added Row and Column shapes to the architecture diagram
   - Added explanatory notes for the new shapes
   - Updated the shape system classification

4. Added changelog entry:
   - Documented the new Row and Column shapes
   - Explained the architectural improvements
   - Added diagrams showing the enhanced shape system

The Row and Column shapes can now be used with any effect, including TargetedRevealEffect. They will:
1. Row: Reveal all matching monsters in the same row as the center position
2. Column: Reveal all matching monsters in the same column as the center position
3. Both respect grid boundaries and only affect valid positions

Would you like me to make any adjustments to these changes?
