_**Assistant**_

Let me help track down and fix this bug. The error indicates we're getting a `Collection was modified` exception during enumeration, which typically happens when trying to modify a collection while iterating over it.

Let me search for the relevant code first.

I see the issue. The error occurs because we're trying to modify a collection while iterating over it in the `StateManager.OnTurnEnd()` method. Let's fix this by making the following changes:

1. First, let's read the current implementation of the `StateManager` to confirm our understanding.

I see the issue. The problem is that we're modifying the collection while iterating over it in the `OnTurnEnd` method. Even though we're using a separate list for expired states, the issue might be occurring because some state's `OnTurnEnd` method is trying to modify the collection.

Let's fix this by:
1. Creating a safe copy of the states to process
2. Adding more debug logging to track what's happening
3. Making the state processing more robust

Here's the fix:

The changes I've made:

1. Created a safe copy of the states to process using `ToList()` to prevent collection modification issues
2. Added try-catch blocks around state processing to handle errors gracefully
3. Added more detailed debug logging to track the flow of state processing
4. Made the state removal process more robust with error handling
5. Added logging for state removal to better track what's happening

This should fix the collection modification exception by:
1. Preventing direct modification of the collection during iteration
2. Handling any errors that occur during state processing
3. Ensuring problematic states are removed safely

The error was occurring because something was trying to modify the `m_ActiveStates` collection while we were iterating over it. By creating a safe copy first and adding proper error handling, we should now be able to process the states safely.

Let me know if you'd like me to make any additional changes or if you need any clarification about the fix.
