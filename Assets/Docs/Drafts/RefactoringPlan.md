# Minesweeper Codebase Refactoring Plan

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
1. Clear separation of concerns with distinct directories (Core, Managers, Views, UI)
2. Well-structured core game components with dedicated subsystems
3. Strategy pattern implementation for mine display and copy operations
4. Event-driven architecture with dedicated Events system
5. Factory pattern usage for object creation

### Areas for Improvement
1. High coupling between MineManager and CellView (394 lines suggests too many responsibilities)
2. Potential duplication in mine-related strategies
3. Lack of clear dependency injection system
4. Mixed responsibility in GridManager (132 lines)
5. Complex state management spread across multiple components

## Refactoring Goals
1. Reduce coupling between components
2. Improve code maintainability and testability
3. Standardize design patterns usage
4. Enhance system scalability
5. Optimize performance bottlenecks

## Step-by-Step Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Improvements
1. Implement Dependency Injection
   - Create IoC container
   - Define service interfaces
   - Move service registration to composition root
   - Estimated time: 2 days

2. State Management Refactor
   - Centralize game state management
   - Implement observer pattern for state changes
   - Create state machine for game flow
   - Estimated time: 2 days

### Phase 2: Component Decomposition
1. Split MineManager
   - Extract mine generation logic
   - Separate mine state management
   - Create dedicated mine rule processor
   - Estimated time: 2 days

2. Refactor CellView
   - Extract presentation logic
   - Create dedicated cell state handler
   - Implement MVP pattern
   - Estimated time: 2 days

### Phase 3: Pattern Implementation
1. Command Pattern for Game Actions
   - Implement command queue
   - Add undo/redo capability
   - Create command factory
   - Estimated time: 1 day

2. Strategy Pattern Enhancement
   - Consolidate mine display strategies
   - Create strategy factory
   - Implement strategy context
   - Estimated time: 1 day

### Phase 4: System Optimization
1. Performance Improvements
   - Implement object pooling
   - Optimize update loops
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Estimated time: 1 day

2. Memory Management
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Add memory monitoring
   - Estimated time: 1 day

```

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Core domain logic
   - Service layer
   - Command handlers
   - Strategy implementations

2. Integration Tests
   - Component interaction
   - State management
   - Event system

3. Performance Tests
   - Grid generation
   - Mine placement
   - UI responsiveness

## Risk Assessment
1. High-Risk Areas
   - State management refactoring
   - View component decomposition
   - Performance impact during refactoring

2. Mitigation Strategies
   - Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring
   - Gradual implementation with feature toggles
   - Regular performance profiling
   - Backup of critical components

## Success Metrics
1. Code Quality
   - Reduced cyclomatic complexity
   - Improved test coverage
   - Decreased coupling metrics

2. Performance
   - Faster initialization time
   - Reduced memory allocation
   - Improved frame rate stability

3. Maintenance
   - Reduced bug fix time
   - Easier feature implementation
   - Better code review process

## Timeline and Priorities
1. Phase 1: 4 days
2. Phase 2: 4 days
3. Phase 3: 2 days
4. Phase 4: 2 days

Total estimated time: 12 working days

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve refactoring plan
2. Set up monitoring and metrics collection
3. Create feature toggles for gradual rollout
4. Begin with Phase 1 implementation

## Notes
- Regular progress reviews recommended
- Consider creating backup branches for each phase
- Document all architectural decisions
- Update unit tests alongside refactoring
