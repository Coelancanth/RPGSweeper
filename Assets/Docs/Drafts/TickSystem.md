# Tick System Design

## Concept Analysis

### What is a Tick System?

A tick system is a time-measurement mechanism that divides game time into small, discrete units called "ticks." Unlike a traditional turn-based system where actions happen in complete turns, a tick system allows for more granular timing of events and actions. Each action or event can consume a specific number of ticks, allowing for varying durations within the game world.

### Advantages Over Pure Turn-Based Systems

1. **Variable Action Duration**: Different actions can take different amounts of time.
2. **Concurrent Processes**: Multiple processes (like status effects, digestion, cooldowns) can progress simultaneously.
3. **Timing Precision**: More precise control over when events occur, allowing for deeper gameplay mechanics.
4. **Rate-Based Mechanics**: Easily implement mechanics based on rates (attack speed, movement speed, etc.).
5. **Smoother Transitions**: Create smoother transitions between game states, especially for time-based effects.

## Implementation Design

### Core Tick System Architecture

1. **Global Tick Counter**: A central counter that tracks the current game tick.
2. **Tickable Interface**: An interface for any game entity that needs to respond to tick updates.
3. **Tick Scheduler**: A system to schedule events to occur at specific future ticks.
4. **Tick Manager**: Coordinates advancing the tick counter and notifying all tickable entities.

### Integration with Turn-Based System

The tick system can be integrated with an existing turn-based system in several ways:

1. **Turns as Tick Bundles**: Define a turn as a fixed number of ticks (e.g., 1 turn = 100 ticks).
2. **Action Tick Costs**: Assign each action a tick cost (e.g., attack = 20 ticks, move = 10 ticks).
3. **Turn Advancement**: A turn advances when all actors have spent their available ticks.
4. **Actor Initiative**: Actors can act when they accumulate enough ticks, creating a natural initiative system.

### Pseudocode Implementation

```csharp
// Core interfaces
public interface ITickable
{
    void OnTick();
    bool IsActive { get; }
}

// The central tick management system
public class TickManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private static TickManager _instance;
    public static TickManager Instance => _instance;
    
    public long CurrentTick { get; private set; } = 0;
    private List<ITickable> _tickables = new List<ITickable>();
    private Dictionary<long, List<Action>> _scheduledEvents = new Dictionary<long, List<Action>>();
    
    // Register a tickable entity
    public void RegisterTickable(ITickable tickable)
    {
        if (!_tickables.Contains(tickable))
            _tickables.Add(tickable);
    }
    
    // Remove a tickable entity
    public void UnregisterTickable(ITickable tickable)
    {
        _tickables.Remove(tickable);
    }
    
    // Schedule an event to occur at a specific future tick
    public void ScheduleEvent(long ticksFromNow, Action action)
    {
        long targetTick = CurrentTick + ticksFromNow;
        
        if (!_scheduledEvents.ContainsKey(targetTick))
            _scheduledEvents[targetTick] = new List<Action>();
            
        _scheduledEvents[targetTick].Add(action);
    }
    
    // Advance the game by a specific number of ticks
    public void AdvanceTicks(int ticks)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < ticks; i++)
        {
            AdvanceSingleTick();
        }
    }
    
    // Advance the game by a single tick
    private void AdvanceSingleTick()
    {
        CurrentTick++;
        
        // Process any scheduled events for this tick
        if (_scheduledEvents.TryGetValue(CurrentTick, out var events))
        {
            foreach (var scheduledEvent in events)
            {
                scheduledEvent.Invoke();
            }
            _scheduledEvents.Remove(CurrentTick);
        }
        
        // Update all tickable entities
        for (int i = _tickables.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            if (_tickables[i].IsActive)
                _tickables[i].OnTick();
        }
    }
}

// Example of integrating with turn-based system
public class TurnBasedGameController
{
    public const int TICKS_PER_TURN = 100;
    
    private Dictionary<Actor, int> _remainingTicksPerActor = new Dictionary<Actor, int>();
    private List<Actor> _actors = new List<Actor>();
    
    public int CurrentTurn { get; private set; } = 0;
    
    // Start a new turn
    public void StartNewTurn()
    {
        CurrentTurn++;
        
        // Reset available ticks for all actors
        foreach (var actor in _actors)
        {
            _remainingTicksPerActor[actor] = TICKS_PER_TURN;
        }
    }
    
    // An actor performs an action
    public void PerformAction(Actor actor, GameAction action)
    {
        // Verify actor has enough ticks remaining
        if (_remainingTicksPerActor[actor] >= action.TickCost)
        {
            // Perform the action
            action.Execute();
            
            // Deduct the tick cost
            _remainingTicksPerActor[actor] -= action.TickCost;
            
            // Advance the overall game ticks
            TickManager.Instance.AdvanceTicks(action.TickCost);
        }
    }
    
    // Check if turn is complete (all actors have spent their ticks)
    public bool IsTurnComplete()
    {
        foreach (var actor in _actors)
        {
            if (_remainingTicksPerActor[actor] > 0)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Example Use Cases

### Digestion System

```csharp
public class DigestiveSystem : MonoBehaviour, ITickable
{
    public int DigestionRate = 1; // Food units digested per tick
    public int CurrentFoodAmount = 0;
    
    private void Start()
    {
        TickManager.Instance.RegisterTickable(this);
    }
    
    public void OnTick()
    {
        // Process digestion each tick
        if (CurrentFoodAmount > 0)
        {
            CurrentFoodAmount = Mathf.Max(0, CurrentFoodAmount - DigestionRate);
            
            // Notify when digestion completes
            if (CurrentFoodAmount == 0)
            {
                Debug.Log("Food fully digested!");
            }
        }
    }
    
    public bool IsActive => CurrentFoodAmount > 0;
    
    public void ConsumeFood(int amount, out int ticksToDigest)
    {
        CurrentFoodAmount += amount;
        ticksToDigest = Mathf.CeilToInt((float)CurrentFoodAmount / DigestionRate);
    }
}
```

### Attack Speed System

```csharp
public class CombatSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int BaseAttackTicks = 50; // Base ticks needed for one attack
    
    public void PerformAttack(Actor attacker, Actor target)
    {
        // Calculate actual attack ticks based on attacker's stats
        float attackSpeedMultiplier = attacker.GetAttackSpeedMultiplier();
        int actualAttackTicks = Mathf.RoundToInt(BaseAttackTicks / attackSpeedMultiplier);
        
        // Deal damage immediately
        target.TakeDamage(attacker.CalculateDamage());
        
        // Schedule when the next attack can happen
        TickManager.Instance.ScheduleEvent(actualAttackTicks, () => {
            attacker.SetCanAttack(true);
        });
        
        // Prevent attacking until cooldown completes
        attacker.SetCanAttack(false);
    }
}
```

## Tick System for Status Effects

```csharp
public class StatusEffect : ITickable
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int DurationInTicks { get; private set; }
    public int RemainingTicks { get; private set; }
    public Actor AffectedActor { get; private set; }
    
    public StatusEffect(string name, int durationInTicks, Actor affectedActor)
    {
        Name = name;
        DurationInTicks = durationInTicks;
        RemainingTicks = durationInTicks;
        AffectedActor = affectedActor;
        
        TickManager.Instance.RegisterTickable(this);
        Apply();
    }
    
    public void OnTick()
    {
        RemainingTicks--;
        OnTickEffect();
        
        if (RemainingTicks <= 0)
        {
            Remove();
        }
    }
    
    public bool IsActive => RemainingTicks > 0;
    
    // Override in derived classes
    protected virtual void Apply()
    {
        Debug.Log($"{Name} applied to {AffectedActor.name} for {DurationInTicks} ticks");
    }
    
    // Override in derived classes
    protected virtual void OnTickEffect()
    {
        // Default implementation does nothing each tick
    }
    
    // Override in derived classes
    protected virtual void Remove()
    {
        Debug.Log($"{Name} removed from {AffectedActor.name}");
        TickManager.Instance.UnregisterTickable(this);
    }
}

// Example: Poison status effect
public class PoisonStatusEffect : StatusEffect
{
    private int _damagePerTick;
    
    public PoisonStatusEffect(Actor target, int duration, int damagePerTick) 
        : base("Poison", duration, target)
    {
        _damagePerTick = damagePerTick;
    }
    
    protected override void OnTickEffect()
    {
        // Deal poison damage each tick
        AffectedActor.TakeDamage(_damagePerTick);
        Debug.Log($"{AffectedActor.name} takes {_damagePerTick} poison damage. {RemainingTicks} ticks remaining.");
    }
}
```

## Challenges and Optimizations

### Potential Challenges

1. **State Synchronization**: Ensuring all systems remain in sync when advancing ticks.
2. **Performance Overhead**: Managing many tickable entities can become expensive.
3. **Determinism**: Maintaining deterministic behavior when using tick-based simulation.
4. **Save/Load Complexity**: Saving and loading the state of all tick-based processes.

### Optimizations

1. **Tick Bucketing**: Group entities by how frequently they need updates (every tick, every 5 ticks, etc.)
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Only calculate state changes when observed, not every tick.
3. **Spatial Partitioning**: Only tick entities relevant to current gameplay.
4. **Parallelization**: Process independent tickable entities in parallel.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the `TickManager` singleton
2. Define the `ITickable` interface
3. Implement the event scheduling system
4. Integrate with the turn system by defining tick costs for actions
5. Convert time-based mechanics to use ticks
6. Implement status effects using the tick system
7. Add optimizations based on performance profiling

## Conclusion

A tick system provides a flexible foundation for complex time-based game mechanics while maintaining the structure of a turn-based game. By assigning tick costs to actions and processes, the game can model different durations with much greater precision than a pure turn-based system.

This system enables more sophisticated gameplay mechanics like variable attack speeds, complex status effects, and time-based resource management, all while preserving the core turn-based structure that gives players time to consider their decisions.
