# Mine Implementation Process

## Strategy Pattern for Mine Copying

### IMineCopyStrategy Interface


Added Strategy Pattern for Mine Copying:
- IMineCopyStrategy interface defines how to copy mine properties
- StandardMineCopyStrategy for basic mines (no special properties)
- MonsterMineCopyStrategy for monster mines (copies HP)
- MineCopyStrategyFactory to create appropriate strategies
- Split CopyMine into smaller, focused methods:
  - ValidateCopyPositions handles all position validation
  - UpdateCellView handles visual updates
- Main CopyMine method orchestrates the process

Benefits of this refactoring:
- Single Responsibility: Each class/method has one job
- Open/Closed: Easy to add new mine types without modifying existing code
- Dependency Inversion: High-level code depends on abstractions
- Better error handling and validation
- More maintainable and testable code
To add a new mine type:
- Create a new strategy class implementing IMineCopyStrategy
- Add the new type to MineCopyStrategyFactory
- No changes needed to existing code

This makes the code more maintainable and easier to extend for new mine types in the future.
Would you like me to make any adjustments to this refactoring?
