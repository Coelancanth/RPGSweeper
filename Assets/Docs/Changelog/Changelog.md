# [v0.2.0] Attribute System Integration - 2025-02-27
# Overview
- This update introduces integration strategies for connecting the new attribute and buff system with existing game entities. The primary goal is to enable a smooth transition path without requiring major refactoring of existing code.

# Change Details
## New Features
- Added three integration approaches for the attribute system:
  - **Composition Approach**: Adds Entity components to existing classes
  - **Interface Adapter Approach**: Creates adapter interfaces to bridge systems
  - **Registry Approach**: Maintains a central registry mapping existing objects to entity representations
- Detailed implementation examples showing how to connect MonsterMine and Player classes with the attribute system
- Non-invasive integration path that preserves backward compatibility

## Adjustments and Refactoring
- Updated implementation plan in BuffSystem.md to include integration phase
- Modified the existing architecture to support gradual adoption of the attribute system
- Added documentation for integration patterns and example implementations
