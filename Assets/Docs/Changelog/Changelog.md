```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CellView {
        -m_HasMine: bool
        +HandleMineRemoval()
        +OnMouseDown()
    }
    class MineManager {
        -m_Mines: Dictionary
        +HandleMineRemoval(Vector2Int)
    }
    class MineValuePropagator {
        +PropagateValues()
        -PropagateValueFromMine()
    }
    class GameEvents {
        +OnMineRemovalAttempted
        +RaiseMineRemovalAttempted()
    }
    CellView --> GameEvents
    MineManager --> MineValuePropagator
    GameEvents --> MineManager
```

### Optimizations
- Improved value propagation system to handle empty cells
- Enhanced cell state management for mine removal
- Optimized value recalculation for better performance

# v0.1.3 - 2025-02-12 03:55:25
## Overview
Improved cell state management system with better encapsulation and simplified value text handling.

## Change Details
### Adjustments and Refactoring
#### Cell State Management
- Removed redundant value text visibility checks
- Consolidated visibility logic within state system
- Improved encapsulation by removing unnecessary public property
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CellView {
        -m_IsRevealed: bool
        -m_ValueText: TextMeshPro
        +UpdateVisuals(bool)
        +SetValue(int)
    }
    class ICellState {
        <<interface>>
        +Enter(CellView)
        +UpdateVisuals(CellView)
    }
    CellView --> ICellState
    note for CellView "Simplified state management\nImproved encapsulation"
```

### Optimizations
- Reduced code duplication in visibility management
- Simplified state transitions
- Improved maintainability of cell view system

# v0.1.2 - 2024-02-12 02:30:13
## Overview
Fixed critical visualization issues in the cell reveal system, ensuring proper visual feedback when cells are revealed.

## Change Details
### Bug Fixes
#### Cell Visualization System
- Fixed sprite renderers not being enabled when cells are revealed
- Added proper renderer state management in cell state transitions
- Ensured consistent visual feedback for cell reveals
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CellView {
        -m_BackgroundRenderer: SpriteRenderer
        -m_MineRenderer: SpriteRenderer
        +SetupRenderers()
        +UpdateVisuals(bool)
    }
    class ICellState {
        <<interface>>
        +Enter(CellView)
        +UpdateVisuals(CellView)
    }
    class HiddenCellState {
        +Enter(CellView)
        +UpdateVisuals(CellView)
    }
    class RevealedEmptyCellState {
        +Enter(CellView)
        +UpdateVisuals(CellView)
    }
    ICellState <|.. HiddenCellState
    ICellState <|.. RevealedEmptyCellState
    CellView --> ICellState
```

### Optimizations
#### Visual System Improvements
- Optimized sprite renderer state management
- Improved visual state transitions
- Enhanced error handling for missing renderers

# v0.1.1 - 2024-02-10 2025-02-10 02:32:41
## Overview
Enhanced the mine visualization system with proper sprite rendering and debug support. This update improves the visual feedback for mines and adds development tools for better debugging.

## Change Details
### New Features
#### Mine Visualization System
- Added separate sprite renderers for cell background and mine sprites
- Implemented proper sprite layer ordering
- Added mine sprite reveal system coordinated with cell reveals
- Created MineDebugger tool for development visualization
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CellView {
        -m_BackgroundRenderer: SpriteRenderer
        -m_MineRenderer: SpriteRenderer
        -m_MineSprite: Sprite
        +ShowMineSprite(Sprite)
        +ShowDebugHighlight(Color)
    }
    class MineDebugger {
        -m_MineManager: MineManager
        -m_CellViews: Dictionary
        +ToggleDebugVisuals()
    }
    MineDebugger --> CellView
```
