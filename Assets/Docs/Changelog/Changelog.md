# v0.1.1 - 2024-02-10 2025-02-10 02:32:41
## Overview
Enhanced the mine visualization system with proper sprite rendering and debug support. This update improves the visual feedback for mines and adds development tools for better debugging.

## Change Details
### New Features
#### Mine Visualization System
- Added separate sprite renderers for cell background and mine sprites
- Implemented proper sprite layer ordering
- Added mine sprite reveal system coordinated with cell reveals
- Created MineDebugger tool for development visualization
```mermaid

    class CellView {
        -m_BackgroundRenderer: SpriteRenderer
        -m_MineRenderer: SpriteRenderer
        -m_MineSprite: Sprite
        +ShowMineSprite(Sprite)
        +ShowDebugHighlight(Color)
    }
    class MineDebugger {
        -m_MineManager: MineManager
        -m_CellViews: Dictionary
        +ToggleDebugVisuals()
    }
    MineDebugger --> CellView
```

### Optimizations
#### Visual System Improvements
- Optimized sprite rendering with proper layer management
- Improved coordination between Grid and Mine managers for reveals
- Added extensive debug logging for development

### Architecture Improvements
- Enhanced separation of concerns in visual components
- Improved error handling and null checks
- Added development tools for better debugging
